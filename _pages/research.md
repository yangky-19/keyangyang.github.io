Simulation of Ring Origami Structures with Larger Packing Ratios
-----
6/2022 - Present   

**Advisor: [Renee Zhao](https://profiles.stanford.edu/264302), Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University**
* Created ABAQUS models to simulate the packing process of ring origami structures with different shapes
* Developed Python programs for parametric modeling, data export and post-processing
* Obtained the relationship between the loading curves and the geometric parameters, loading positions,
cross-sectional shapes, etc. during the folding process

    <b>Figure 5. Empirical image similarity metrics.</b> Group mean (± standard deviation) of the whole-brain averaged mean absolute error (MAE) (a), peak SNR (PSNR) (b), and structural similarity index (SSIM) (c) of the up-sampled low-resolution images and super-resolution results of neural networks trained with 10-repetition averaged and single-repetition high-resolution images across five evaluation subjects. Detailed values are shown in the table (d).

Instability Analysis of Active Soft Material Spherical Shell
-----

7/2021 - 6/2022   

**Advisor: [Bo Li](https://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/hyen/info/1162/1222.htm), Associate Professor of Aerospace Engineering, Tsinghua University**
* Applied the theory of active soft matter to the instability morphology problems in biological systems
* Set up a model of active soft spherical shell, derived the governing equations of shell surface instability using
different active material theories and numerically solved the instability morphology with COMSOL
* Explained the relationship between morphogenesis and defects during the regeneration of hydroids

Realization of Macro-scale Superlubricity Based on Micro-Contacts
-----

09/2021 – 12/2021   

**Advisor: [Ming Ma](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1054/1328.htm), Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University**
* Constructed tens of superlubric systems at the graphite/2D materials (graphite, WS2, SiO2) interface
* Assembled several micro-scale superlubric contact to expand the area of the superlubric system
* Developed a new method to connect micro graphite flakes with PDMS and determined the optimal experimental
parameters in preparation of PDMS film
* Simulated the deformation of PDMS film under a given load with COMSOL
